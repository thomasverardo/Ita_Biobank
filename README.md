# Ita biobank

In this repository it's shown how the implementation of a nationa biobank for storing gene sequence variations in a standardized way (it stores only data from CVF format).

Biobank are defined as collections of biological samples and associated information organised in a systematic way.

Storing gene sequence variations allow us to significantly reduce the size of data, while keeping a large amount of information since variations are considered the most important regions of DNA to study the genomic diseases and predispositions to diseases.

The project is entire build with Django, since it can be possible to create a database with Postgresql and the web application simultaneously
